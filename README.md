# Recognizing-multi-digit-numbers-in-photographs-captured-at-street
Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an importantcomponent of modern-day map making. 
A classic example of a corpus of such streetlevel photographs is Googleâ€™s Street View imagery comprised of hundreds of millions
ofgeo-located 360 degree panoramic images. The ability to automatically transcribe anaddress number from a geo-located patch of
pixels and associate the transcribednumber with a known street address helps pinpoint, with a high degree of accuracy, 
thelocation of the building it represents.More broadly, recognizing numbers in photographs is a problem of interest to the 
opticalcharacter recognition community. While OCR on constrained domains like documentprocessing is well studied, arbitrary 
multi-character text recognition in photographs isstill highly challenging. This difficulty arises due to the wide variability 
in the visualappearance of text in the wild on account of a large range of fonts, colors, styles,orientations, and character 
arrangements. The recognition problem is furthercomplicated by environmental factors such as lighting, shadows, specularities,
andocclusions as well as by image acquisition factors such as resolution, motion, and focusblurs.In this project we will use 
dataset with images centred around a single digit (many of theimages do contain some distractors at the sides). Although we are
taking a sample ofthe data which is simpler, it is more complex than MNIST because of the distractors.The Street View House 
Numbers (SVHN) DatasetSVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and objectrecognition algorithms with 
minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from asignificantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits 
and numbers innatural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street Viewimages.
